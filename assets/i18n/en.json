  "about_who_p1": "Union for Change in 2025 (UPC 2025) is a broad coalition of political parties, civil society associations, personalities, and citizens who aim to unite around a Common Program for Transition and Renewal and present a People's Consensual Candidate for the October 2025 presidential election.",
  "about_who_p2": "Union for Change is not a disparate assembly of candidates selected by the Constitutional Council with divergent agendas; it is a People's Coalition, open to all citizens and organizations — including those whose candidates were unfairly excluded — with a common goal: win the 2025 presidential election and refound Cameroon during a 3–5 year transition.",

  "about_roots_title": "Historical Roots",
  "about_roots_p1": "UPC 2025 draws its roots from the Union for Change of 1992, which had carried the (contested) victory of the coalition candidate Ni John Fru Ndi. Since then, several federating initiatives have emerged: Front of Alternative Forces (FFA), Stand Up for Cameroon (SUFC), Citizen Consultation Framework (C3), Alliance for Transition and Renewal (ATR), etc.",
  "about_roots_p2": "Learning from the past, the 'Douala Group', under the leadership of Anicet Ekane, Djeukam Tchameni, and Sam Mbaka, structured the people's appeal to pool the forces of change, resulting in a Common Program for Transition and Renewal and a transparent process to select a People's Consensual Candidate.",

  "about_org_title": "Organizational Structure",
  "about_org_p1": "UPC 2025 is first and foremost a Cameroonian people-driven initiative. Citizens can join individually; political parties and civil society associations can also participate. The structure is light and largely decentralized: the people take control of the campaign.",
  "about_org_p2": "The basic unit is the conscious citizen who registers (online or in person), promotes the Common Program, participates in the candidate's local campaign, votes, and monitors the vote — hence the slogan: 'On October 12, 2025, everything depends on me'.",
  "about_org_p3": "In each commune, citizens form local Committees (online or at the local office). The local Committee carries out door-to-door, organizes meetings, encourages participation and vote protection, and enters polling station results into the parallel counting software.",
