  "about_who_title": "Who are we?",
  "about_who_p1": "Union for Change 2025 (UPC 2025) is a broad coalition of political parties, civil society organizations, public figures and citizens uniting around a Common Program for Transition and Refoundation and presenting a Consensus People’s Candidate for the October 2025 presidential election.",
  "about_who_p2": "Union for Change is not a disparate lineup of candidates approved by the Constitutional Council with divergent agendas; it is a People’s Coalition open to all citizens and organizations — including those whose candidates were unfairly excluded — with one goal: win the 2025 presidential election and refound Cameroon over a 3–5 year transition.",

  "about_roots_title": "Historical roots",
  "about_roots_p1": "UPC 2025 draws from the 1992 Union for Change which carried the (contested) victory of coalition candidate Ni John Fru Ndi. Since then, several federating initiatives have emerged: Front des Forces Alternatives (FFA), Stand Up for Cameroon (SUFC), Cadre Citoyen de Concertation (C3), Alliance pour la Transition et la Refondation (ATR), etc.",
  "about_roots_p2": "Learning from past experiences, the “Douala Group” — led by Anicet Ekane, Djeukam Tchameni and Sam Mbaka — structured a people’s call to pool the forces of change, resulting in a Common Program for Transition and Refoundation and a transparent process to choose a Consensus People’s Candidate.",

  "about_org_title": "Organizational structure",
  "about_org_p1": "Union for Change 2025 is first and foremost an initiative of the Cameroonian people. Individuals, political parties and civil society organizations can join. The structure is light and highly decentralized: people lead the campaign.",
  "about_org_p2": "The basic unit is the conscious citizen who registers (online or in person), promotes the Common Program, joins the grassroots campaign for the Consensus Candidate, votes and protects their vote — hence the slogan: “On 12 October 2025, it all depends on me.”",
  "about_org_p3": "In each municipality, citizens form Local Committees (online or via the headquarters). The local committee conducts door-to-door outreach, organizes meetings, encourages turnout and vote protection, and records polling-station results in the parallel tally system.",
